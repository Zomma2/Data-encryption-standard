# Data-encryption-standard
The objective of the following assignment is to implement a fully working DES algorithm that can encrypt or decrypt the given input. The DES cipher includes many stages and modules to implement, although none of them is difficult. As assistance, I am going to list the main concepts you need implemented to have a working DES cipher: ▪ ▪ ▪ ▪ ▪ Permutation Box – you need to implement how a permutation box works given a specific input and calculate the output whether it’s 64-bit to 64-bit box or when the output is of different size than the input. S-Box – you need to implement how the S-box works; take an input of 6 bits, and output only 4 bits using the concept of S-Boxes as you will later do it with 8 S-Boxes and a 48-bit input in the DES cipher. Key Generator – you now need to implement the generator that takes a 64-bit key input, and outputs 16 keys whose size is 48-bit each. DES Function – finally, you will implement the DES function itself where the magic happens. Later, you will implement the 16-round functionality. After finishing your DES encryption algorithm, tweak it so that it does decryption instead of encryption. Hint: Look at the key!
